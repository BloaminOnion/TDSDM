# Working through The Data Science Design Manual

This is my attempt to work though "The Data Science Design Manual."  I will only present my answers to questions.  As this is a self-driven effort, I get to pick and choose the questions to answer.  Any questions that require additional material to answer will be uploaded as well, although I will refrain from uploading raw datasets or the like.
